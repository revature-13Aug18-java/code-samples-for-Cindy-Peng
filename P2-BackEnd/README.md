C and C Investments is a stock portfolio application that allows users 
to manage their shares. They can search companies for their stocks and 
buy or sell them. They can also see their history of transactions. This 
directory holds the code samples for the back end application.

- Used Spring Data and JPA to map Java objects to the database.
- Created REST controllers to provide front end with information from 
the database.
- Git branch management for continuous integration and version control.
- Hosted backend Spring Boot application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Incorporated JUnit testing with spring-boot-starter-test dependency to 
test the REST controllers.
