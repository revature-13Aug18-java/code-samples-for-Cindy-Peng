C and C Investments is a stock portfolio application that allows users
to manage their shares. They can search companies for their stocks and
buy or sell them. They can also see their history of transactions.

- HTML, CSS, AJAX, DevOps, Angular, Git
- Used Angular's HttpClient to make AJAX calls to the API and REST 
endpoints.
- Session management with Angular's localStorage.
- Learned to combine two-way binding, one-way event binding, and 
structural directives to handle form control.
- Used life cycle hooks like ngOninit to prepare the pages with 
information from the API or database as needed.
- Used AWS Code Pipeline to set up the front end Angular pipeline.
